The budgeting application makes a collection of accounts and with any account a collection of transactions that can be used to track spending and income. These accounts and transactions are stored in CSV files. The program is strict about the files being named accounts.csv and transactions.csv. The program will save and load accounts and transactions from the files named in this way. The CSV files must be saved within the final project folder for the program to find them. The program will also calculate some basic metrics using the report function, which can be selected in the main menu.

The program has a lot of room for growth, but sits at a functional point that it could be used for basic budget tracking. The goal eventually of the program is to have a GUI to make budget interaction and creation simpler. There is also potential to add additional types of accounts and reports. I hope you enjoy what I have created so far!
